# New job @ Cursor

In September, I left my job at Airtable. I worked there for three years on product initiatives including new visualizations, new product lines, new platforms, and ultimately AI features that helped people build Airtable bases and interact with Airtable in new ways. 

I had a lovely three years, and worked with some great people that I hopefully will get a chance to work with again (it’s always a smaller world than I expect). 
I went to Airtable after working for many years on backend and distributed systems problems at Dropbox, with a goal to broaden my horizons to see and learn what frontend development is all about. 
It lived up to my expectations as a great place to work on frontend and product problems for a product loved by millions of happy customers. 

I was lucky to be at a place like Airtable when the LLM boom started that pushed me to go learn about and try to build AI features. 
As I learned more about how to use AI tools, there was one particular tool that I ended up using every day, and heard about from basically every part of the company: Cursor.

I started working at Cursor at the end of September. Even though it has not been a full two months, these weeks might have been more impactful to me than the past few years. 
I’ll write down more about why I think this is in the future, but as a sneak peak, it’s a combination of:
1. Full freedom for employees to move as efficiently as they can.
2. Leadership that keeps the company focused and moving rapidly in a coherent direction, while also being incredibly receptive to feedback.
3. A world-class collection of people that effortlessly show me just how much I still have to learn and improve.

Cursor is a much smaller company than Airtable or Dropbox were when I joined them, and I’m excited to be a part of helping it grow. And of course, [Cursor is hiring](https://cursor.com/careers)! Come help build the future of Software creation with me 😃.
