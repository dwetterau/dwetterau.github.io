# Send pulls not problems

I can't take credit for the origin of this phrase, but I certainly promulgated it.
For anyone not familiar with Github's terminology a pull request is (in non-technical terms) a proposed change to some code, that a reviewer can opt to accept, request revisions, or reject entirely.
A restating of this phrase would be something like: "don't just complain about something, propose a solution", but that's not nearly as catchy.

## How to apply this mantra

If you're working at a technology company in 2024, you probably have a large shared codebase (e.g. a monorepo).
One giant advantage of this arrangement is that you have the power to go see how anything works, or suggest changes and improvements to them.

If there is a small quirk in some tool that you're using, or something you think could be better about a user interface you often have to use, try giving yourself a time-boxed amount of time (probably no more than 15 minutes) to go find it in the codebase and fix it.
If you manage to fix it, send the team that owns the feature a pull request about it! 
The team might not accept it, so don't get too attached to these "throw-it-over-the-wall" fixes, but they will certainly follow up with you about it if you've taken the time to try to change it.

After 15 minutes is up, if you haven't succeeded in making your change but still think it's important, then you can go find the responsible team and post about your complaint. 
Since you've dug in, you'll have more empathy with the team about why it might not be a simple fix to perform, and you can share notes about what you tried that didn't work out to let them build off of your work.

## Caveats

You must take care to not overuse this expression, or use it with the wrong tone. 
When used incorrectly, you can definitely come off as a jerk by saying this without appropriate care.
I strongly prefer to use this expression as a suggestion when the complaint is about something I'm not responsible for, since if I am responsible for it, it can be interpretted as defensive.
