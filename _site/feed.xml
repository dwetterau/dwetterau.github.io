Alas, I fell into the same trap.</p>

<p>In my defence, the issue is that setting up a blog is a complicated mess, even in 2024.
In order to see if it’s working at all, I need to make sure that I can actually make posts and view them.</p>

<p>So in this post, I’ll try to write down what I did to make this.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>I already had a website, running at <a href="/">https://davidw.tech</a>, and hosted on github pages.
How that happened will have to be a different post, it’s been around for a long time.</li>
  <li>I followed some random <a href="https://github.com/chadbaldwin/simple-blog-bootstrap">Github repo</a> I found that was relatively recent (3 years old) and also based on Github pages.
Copying the actual files and settings from this turned out to be a total mistake.
I realized this when I found and followed <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">Github’s own guide</a> on how to do this, which I originally got to by trying to figure out how to test this locally.</li>
  <li>Now I have a functioning blog, but it also replaced every other part of my old website, since Jekyll didn’t seem happy to build in a subdirectory on Github Pages (where this is hosted).</li>
  <li>I’ll figure out how to customize more parts of this later, but for now I have it working!</li>
</ol>

<p>This process took at least 3 days of off-and-on tinkering. Now that I have it working, I have a lot of work to do to replace all of the links and past project pages that I used to have.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Follow Github’s guide for setting up a repo and using Jekyll in it.
I found that I needed to have a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file that everything in the repo used, otherwise there were build failures in the Github action that tried to build the pages.</li>
  <li>I highly recommend figuring out how to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll">get this all working locally</a> too, to avoid having to push a bunch of broken configurations and waiting ~45 seconds for Github to slowly build them.</li>
  <li>Copy things from the up-to-date sources.
For me this meant the Github guides, but also for customizing the CSS on the about page, I made sure I was referencing and forking the layouts from the theme’s repo.
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll">Github’s guide on customizing the themes</a> is helpful to know where to find these theme repos.</li>
