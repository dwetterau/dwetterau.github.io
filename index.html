  This is David Wetterau's blog. I live in New York City and work as a Software
  Engineer at Airtable. In my time at Airtable, I've worked on new user-facing
  product features, new product verticals, and on all-sorts-of AI things. For
  many years, I worked at Dropbox primarily on the distributed systems that
  store and sync files and folders for millions of users.
