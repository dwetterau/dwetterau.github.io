<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
  This is David Wetterau's blog. I live in New York City and work as a Software
  Engineer at Airtable. In my time at Airtable I've worked on new user-facing
  product features, new product verticals, and on all-sort-of-things AI. For
  many years, I worked at Dropbox primarily on the distributed systems that
  store and sync files and folders for millions of users.

Many of my early posts will be about working in tech, but I hope to write about
some other topics soon!
