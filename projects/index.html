            After my first semester of school senior year, I was looking for a side project to work on over the winter
            break. I remembered back to one point in my life when I had wanted to try to keep a journal of my life so
            that I could read it in the future and remember everything that I had done as a kid. Starting a journal was
            something that I tried to do multiple times but each time I only managed to make it a few days before
            forgetting about it or getting frustrated with it. I decided I wanted to try to start a journal again, but
            this time I thought of ways that I could leverage the myriad of APIs that already track the events of my
            life to help me.
            <br />
            <br />
            One key thing I realized when I was thinking of this project was that there was a lot of stuff in my life
            that I wanted to say or express in some way, but there wasn't really anyone I wanted to say it to. This is
            of course the point of a diary but the corollary to today's world would be a Facebook type product that you
            can post things to without those things ever being shared. What I realized I wanted to make and use was a
            social network type project that was completely antisocial.
            <br />
            <br />
            Life is a project that I'm just getting started on. I launched the first version of the website on December
            30th, 2014 but it's certainly not feature complete. I wanted to get this website out there mainly so I could
            start using it myself to record my thoughts throughout the day in it. Some of the upcoming features for the
            website will be the ability to label your events, automatic Dropbox photo integration (your newly updated
            photos automatically are added to your life timeline), and a mobile app to add events on the go.

            Recently I was using the Snapchat messaging functionality that allows messages to be read only once and
            although I liked the idea, their interface for it was awful. Because of this, I set out to build a
            similar messaging service that would also work on the web through shareable links. In the end, the
            service converged to a system like email, with a subject and a body, with the body only being able to
            be viewed once. I implemented this by having two records in a SQL table for each message, a metadata
            record that stores the header and information about who sent it, and a message record that stores the
            actual content of the message. The only request that can retrieve the content of the message deletes
            the record from the database so that it can only be read once.
            <br />
            <br />
            One interesting feature I added that Snapchat's messenger doesn't have is the possibility for
            anonymity. You can use the website and generate a message without it being to tied to an account of any
            kind. The downside is that the first person who gets the shareable link is the only one who can view it.
            To enable more control over the message, you can create an account and specify a recipient who will then
            be the only person who can ever retrieve the message body from the server (not even the sender can see
            it again).
            <br />
            <br />
            I'll probably add more functionality to this project in the future because I'm very much interested in
            how the world communicates. I think there's something very fundamental to how we interact that a
            messaging service like this or Snapchat provides; spoken word is often not recorded forever like most
            services around today. I believe that because of this, there will always be a desire for record-less
            communication.

            I was preparing for an interview with <a href="http://www.imgur.com">Imgur</a> in my senior year of
            college and one thing I decided to do was familiarize myself with the technologies they said they used
            on their public blog. I went about this by trying to implement as much as Imgur as I could and I got
            pretty far (except I ended up using node.js instead of PHP). The application I made was a node app
            written in Coffeescript that uses MySQL (with an ORM), Redis for image ranking, and nginx.
            <br />
            <br />
            At one point, my friends at school wanted to try using it so I started hosting it on my tiny
            DigitalOcean instance and let them use it and help me refine it. The live website itself can be found
            at the link above and of course all of the code can be found on Github.

            At HackTX 2014, my college friends and I decided to make a web application that could potentially
            replace display advertising on the internet. The inspiration for this project was a project called
            <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6713537">Tidbit</a>, which mined bitcoins in a browser
            when someone visited a website. We like to think of this approach as a way to pay for the websites you
            use everyday with your CPU cycles (after opting in) instead of your personal information (which is what
            targetted advertising today relies on).
            <br />
            <br />
            Countdera specifically was a Javascript Framework that allowed people to upload map and reduce functions
            (written in Javascript), provide links to input files, and run MapReduce style jobs on their input data.
            We demonstrated this functionality at the hackathon with a simple word counting program running on the
            text of the US constitution and you can see how this works in
            <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qn03a659bh1k49h/20141019_102403.mp4?dl=0">this video</a>. We used
            Firebase as a way to keep track of all the worker nodes (visitors to websites with an embedded iframe
            instead  of a display ad) and as a way for worker nodes to communicate to each other. We also didn't
            exactly implement MapReduce, the day before the hackathon, I designed a protocol for us to implement
            which is described in great detail at the link above. This worked reasonably well but there are a few
            optimizations and improvements that we would need to make to deploy something like this that we outline
            on the GitHub readme. The reception of Countdera at the hackathon was quite positive and we even had the
            opportunity to present it in the finals to all of the contestants.
            <br />
            <br />
            I personally believe that the world is moving in a direction that will value personal privacy more than
            in the past and I think that eliminating targeted advertising is a good start. I even wrote a
            <a href="/assets/OnlineTracking.pdf">very long paper</a> about targeted advertising once for a class in
            college. I built Countdera with John Agnew, Dan Rutledge, Jim Given, and Josh Slocum.

            After my internship at Dropbox I became interested in ways that people collaborated in documents. I set out
            to emulate the Google docs product or at least the real-time collaborative editing part. I read through some
            of the research on the subject and settled on
            <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/file/index/docid/71240/filename/RR-5580.pdf">this paper</a> that was able to
            provide collaborative editing without the use of operational transforms. An implementation of this paper in
            a textarea element using Firebase as the backend is what is available at the demo link above.
            <br />
            <br />
            The issue with this paper that I quickly found is that there is never a way to checkpoint the document since
            someone could always come back online (and change the order of many events), and this makes the calculation
            that computes the state of the document more and more expensive over time (even if you delete everything). I
            thought of an interesting alternative approach that involved using a data structure backed by a
            <a href="https://github.com/dwetterau/node-skiplist">skip list</a> that is sorted by
            <a href="https://github.com/dwetterau/base64-math">base 64 encoded strings</a>. The way my idea worked was
            based off the fact that there is always a rational number between any two rational numbers. Because of this
            simple fact, if you have two items and insert one between them (corresponding inserting a character in a
            string) you can always generate a unique and totally orderable id for that new character.
            <br />
            <br />
            I made a good amount of progress on implementing my new technique, but eventually ran into a weird case
            that happens if two clients (at least one being offline) edit between the same two characters. My solution
            would work meaning it would be eventually consistent, but it would not being intention preserving and
            characters would be interleaved in a strange way. If I ever think of a way to fix it, I might revive this
            project.

            A fellow Dropbox intern and I in the summer of 2014 got together with a full-time designer who was new
            at Dropbox and a mutual friend to build something for
            <a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-hacks-august-2-3-2014">Y Combinator Hacks 2014</a>. We met
            several times before the hackathon to discuss ideas and how we would build them and eventually settled
            on building a lightweight event planning tool to facilitate planning short-lived or spontaneous events
            like grabbing dinner with some friends for instance.
            <br />
            <br />
            When we got to the hackathon, we realized that one of the APIs that we had planned to use (Facebook's
            chat API) was not going to be accessible to us so we switched gears 6 hours into the contest to build
            Touch. The motivation behind Touch is that your phone is pretty useless when you're sitting at a
            computer at work or at home. We thought it would be cool to provide contextually relevant buttons for
            your phone to interact with your computer as an extension of your keyboard. Touch also ended up doubling
            as a fantastic presenter's tool, enabling someone in keynote to switch to a YouTube video for instance
            in the middle of the presentation and back without touching their computer.
            <br />
            <br />
            We relied on Firebase to be a secure communication channel between the computer and your phone. Touch
            only works on Macs currently because it uses something called AppleScript to scrape what tabs you have
            open in chrome or what native applications you are running. More technical details about Touch can be
            found on the GitHub readme. I built Touch with Damon Doucet, Predrag Gruevski, and Ryhan Hassan and
            although we didn't win anything at YC Hacks, we really enjoyed the experience.

            In the middle of February of 2014, a phenomenon called <i>Twitch Plays Pokémon</i> (TPP) swept the media and
            my friend group. The idea was to stream the playing of a video game in such a way that the people watching
            could submit moves to the game and either make progress or cause mayhem. More information on the original
            game can be found in a nice writeup on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon">
            Wikipedia</a> about it.
            <br />
            <br />
            During this time, I decided it would be fun if some of my college friends and I played our own version of it
            so I threw together this project. The project worked by running a laptop in my house at all times with an
            emulator on it running a GameBoy game. I then used the utility ffmpeg to stream a portion of the screen
            that included both the emulator and a console through a webserver powered by
            <a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg">jsmpeg</a>. I then created a small node application that
            served a canvas that showed the stream from my laptop and submitted commands or chat messages from users
            to the emulator itself using the xdotool utility.
            <br />
            <br />
            I shared my version of TPP with my CS honors program at UT (the Turing Scholars program) and we actually
            managed to play through an entire game of Pokémon and win before the real TPP stream did. A more detailed
            writeup on how all the components of this project worked together can be found in the readme on GitHub.

            I have always enjoyed physics and the math behind it so when I learned to program, some of the first
            things I made were physics simulations. This is probably the fourth or fifth one
            I made but it was the first to include many complex collisions in 3 dimensions.
            <br /><br />
            My parents gave me a fantastic book on how to implement a commercial physics engine one Christmas and
            after reading through it, I decided to implement a physics engine like the one the author described in
            Javascript leveraging WebGL libraries for rendering. While implementing this engine, I actually found
            some errata in the book and <a href="https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics/pull/26">corrected
            them</a> in the author's open source C++ implementation. Some small demos of the engine working can be
            seen at the link above and all of the code is available on GitHub.

            My college roommates and I built what we eventually called "Dwopbox" during HackTX 2013. We were
            surprisingly successful during the hackathon and actually
            <a href="http://techzette.com/2013-hacktx-winners-and-finalists/">won the "Hacker Lounge" prize </a>
            for this project. Dwopbox is a peer-to-peer file sharing system written entirely in Javascript that
            uses WebRTC channels to transmit files.
            <br /><br />
            We built Dwopbox in the midst of many of Edward Snowden's NSA revelations which inspired us to think of
            a new way to share files across the Internet without the contents of the files themselves getting into
            the hands of a government. Dwopbox consisted of two parts, a simple Postgres database that stored file
            metadata, and a distributed protocol we created (essentially a simplified version of BitTorrent). The
            protocol allows users who joined a "room" to receive information about the files that the original user
            was sending. Using Chrome's local storage support, we first loaded the chosen files into the
            broadcaster's web browser, then started sending pieces of the file to other web browsers through WebRTC
            data channels. Once a viewer has all parts of the file, some client-side Javascript reconstructs the
            file by pulling it out of local storage and immediately "downloading" it to the device.
            <br /><br />
            The friends I worked on this project with were Calvin MacKenzie, Josh Slocum, Dan Rutledge, and
            Adam Faulkner.

            In the later half of my second year of college, my friend Adam Faulkner and I thought of a startup idea.
            The idea was to make a website that simplifies paying your friends back when one friend pays for something
            like a meal or a monthly bill. Our insight was that if different friends in the same group pay for things,
            the debts could cancel out and result in smaller payments to equalize. This project was one that Adam and I
            took very seriously at times, even going as far as to have secret weekly meetings to discuss our goals.
            <br /><br />
            Over the course of the project, Adam and I were able to experiment with a myriad of new hot technologies.
            These included databases such as Apache's CouchDB, Couchbase, RethinkDB, Cassandra, and finally PostgreSQL
            with the Bookshelf.js ORM. We always wrote the server code in Node.js but experimented with AngularJS for
            the frontend. Working with all of these technologies was probably one of the most intelligent things I could
            have done in college because it taught me how to ramp up quickly and become more comfortable with reading
            documentation and even <a href="https://github.com/B2MSolutions/connect-cassandra">contributing</a> back
            to open source projects.
            <br /><br />
            During my junior year of college, my roommates and I used our website to manage our bills and make sure
            everyone was being paid back. In the end we never could really devote enough time or effort to the project
            and eventually found a website that had the very same as idea and did it with a much better interface called
            <a href="http://www.splitwise.com">Splitwise</a> so we finally gave up on the project for good.

            In my operating systems class first semester sophomore year, my project partner, Adam Faulkner, and I set
            out on an ambitious final project. The class required us to build an operating system called
            <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/overview.html">JOS</a> using some skeleton code. We got to
            start by implementing the bootloader in x86 assembly and slowly moving up through memory management, file
            io, process communication, and eventually a functioning shell. Our professor had us choose whatever final
            project we wanted to Adam and I chose to enable graphics mode and write some cool stuff to run on our
            operating system.
            <br /><br />
            We wrote this game to run on an emulator running our OS mainly because memory was an issue and the game
            state was fully encoded in the framebuffer (the pixels for the ground). In order to compute the arcs that
            the bullets traveled, we had to also enable the floating point unit and allow our operating system to make
            trigonometry calls such as sine and cosine. The game is written in C using SDL and takes in basic keyboard
            input. The other fun part of this project however was getting text to render. Since we weren't in text mode
            in our OS, we had to use a bitmap font and render characters ourselves.
            <br /><br />
            In the end, our professor and TA really loved our project and gave it the best project award. We had also
            ported my <a href="/projects#CRasterization">C Rasterizater</a> to render some 3D triangles, cubes, and axis
            lines all within a tiny emulator running an OS that we wrote ourselves.

            I implemented a 2-dimensional bouncing ball simulation to experiment with Javascript's access to device
            accelerometer data and the math behind momentum based glancing collisions. It was a lot of fun to derive
            the math behind elastic collisions that aren't head on. One interesting result of this was a almost
            labyrinth-style simulation on mobile devices (and some MacBook Pros). You can see the working simulation
            at the link above and the source code is hosted on GitHub.

            After my first internship, I my friend Adam showed me his intern hosts website which had this cool effect
            where it turned a random image into colored ASCII text and rendered it. I wanted to emulate the same effect
            so I made my first student website at UT Austin (originally at cs.utexas.edu/~david) be a page that
            converted three chosen images into black and white text, colored text, or showed the original photo. Over
            the years I tweaked this page as I added more projects and did more work before eventually purchasing my
            first domain (dwett.com) and making a new website for it.
            <br /><br />
            The effect works by examining the pixels that each character is representing, determining the average color
            (for the text color) and the overall density. This density is then used to determine which character
            should be displayed. For example, a very dark area would be rendered with a '@' while a very light area
            might be rendered with '`'. I scored each character in a separate java program that literally rendered each
            character in a white area and calculated the number of pixels that were black using a monospace font.

            Towards the end of high school, I became really interested in how to render 3D scenes. I started out by
            trying to write some Java applets that used a lot of vector math that I derived myself to render points.
            This approach didn't workout however because I could never render anything more than wireframes. My
            freshman year of college however, I took a linear algebra class and got to learn all about matrices. To
            help myself learn, I wrote a matrix library in C for fun and then to show it off, I started reading papers
            on how graphics rendering works on GPUs today.
            <br /><br />
            I taught myself what matrix operations I needed to perform to render scenes in 3D and wrote the graphics
            part of this project in the second semester of my freshman year. The result could render triangles with
            colors along with points and wireframes. Later when I was taking operating systems, my project partner and
            I enabled graphics mode in our OS and ported this library to work on the operating system we wrote. This
            library (and a <a href="/projects#simple-tanks">game</a> that we wrote for the project as well) really wowed
            the professor and we won the best project prize for that year.
