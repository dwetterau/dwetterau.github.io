I live in New York City and work as a Software Engineer at Airtable.
In my time at Airtable I've worked on new user-facing product features, new product verticals, and on all-sort-of-things AI.
For many years, I worked at Dropbox primarily on the distributed systems that store and sync files and folders for millions of users.
I enjoy building systems and products that solve problems for people all around the world.
